        <h3>How it started for me</h3>

        <p>My entry into fpv started around the autumn of 2014. I'd been flicking through YouTube videos one evening when I stumbled across a pilot named <a href="../freestylepilots.html/#charpu">Charpu (Carlos Puertolas)</a>. Carlos was at that time the poster child for fpv quadcopters and sponsored by a company called <a href="http://www.lumenier.com">Lumenier</a>, founded in summer of 2013 by Tim Nilson, the owner of <a href="http://www.getfpv.com">GetFPV.com</a>. Carlos was flying a new, smaller style frame and motor combination that was growing very rapidly in popularity. After watching all his freestyle videos flying through 'bandos' (abandoned
        buildings) I just new I had try this for myself.
        </p>

        <p>2015 and a new job had be distracted but I'd not forgotten Charpu, I continued to researching these videos and around mid year I watched this <a href="https://youtu.be/a8JyCGXrFbk">video</a> showing Charpu being interviewed and explaining the build process for the Lumenier QAV250 quadcopter frame. Whilst I was researching this frame I also stumbled across <a href="https://youtu.be/6bppktLXu2Y">How to Build a Lumenier
        QAV250</a> on a site called FPV Flightclub. This video appealed to my assethetics and convinced me I had enough skills and tools lying around to be able to do this myself. Only a few weeks later, Lumenier announced that they planned to release two new frames in 210 and 180 sizes. My mind was made
        up and I placed my order for the QAV 210 frame the following week.
