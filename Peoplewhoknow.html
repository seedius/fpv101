      <h1>Those that have gone before us</h1>

      <p>This section is designed to introduce you to the names and faces of this hobby, the people that have found the time to build and maintain websites or record and edit videos for our enjoyment. Nearly all of the so called 'celebrities' of this hobby are very grounded and and easy going characters that all want to help people develop. Whether you're looking for inspiration, guides on how to fly, reviews of the latest technologies or a step by step guide to setting up your flight controller.....one of these guys or girls is going to have a produced a resource to help.
      </p>

      <p>One tip that I will recommend is to get yourself an account for Youtube set up and subscribe to the people you enjoy. I've found it a hell of a lot easier to keep track of the latest videos and vlogs being released when I can simply tap into my 'subscribed' channels list and see who's released new content. Plus, subscribing helps these people earn a little money which ultimately allows them to keep producing all these great videos that we so enjoy.
      </p>

      <p>As a parting note on this subject, try not to resent people for making money out of this hobby. I don't think the way of the internet needs to be explained but sometimes its not always obvious to some people. Here's the simple version....companies want to sell more stuff. They give stuff to famous people for free in the hope that you see or read about those famous people using that companies stuff and you say...hmmm, if Mr cool uses their stuff then I will to. In return, famous people make videos and guides for us. If you want free stuff all you need to do is spend hundreds of hours every building a creative video blog and rack up a huge number of subscribers.
      <br>
      If you don't have the time or talent to do that yourself....then you can get others to do it for you by buying technology they review and use. Simple!
