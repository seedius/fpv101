        <h3>My first quadcopter</h3>

        <p><img id="qav210" src="images/qav210.jpg" alt="Lumenier QAV210 Frame">One thing I'd realised fairly early on in the process was that this hobby wasn't exactly going to be cheap and in order to try and balance this
        investment with the rest of my family commitments I'd made the decision to spread out my purchases accross a 6 month period and build the quad up bit by bit. Other than the frame, the other component I'd already made the decision on was to get the Taranis X9D+ radio. Charpu used the Taranis, as did other pilots and there was a ton of information availble to read online which reassured my that it was well regarded and well supported.
        <br><br>
        <img id="taranis" src="images/taranis.jpg" alt="Taranis X9D+ Radio"> Christmas secured that from my wife which opened up the oppourtunity to practice flying on a simulator. One of the neat things about the Taranis is that it can be plugged into a PC or Mac and used to control the simulator just like you would use a gaming pad. So now I'm set, I'll build the quad and learn to fly on my mac ahead of time. This actually turned out to be a pretty solid tactic and one I'd recommend if you're in a similar posistion and can't afford to splash
        the whole investment in one go.

        <p><img id="naze32" src="images/Naze32 Rev6.jpg" alt="Naze 32 Acro Revision 6">Next up was the decision about flight controller but in all honesty there wasn't much of debate at that time, the controller that everyone was hyped about at that time was the Naze32. By todays standards it's basic but at the time it was the board of choice for most people and had great support in the community. There were four versions released, 6 DOF, ACRO, 10 DOF and Full. This <a href="http://www.dronetrest.com/t/naze-32-versions-explained-and-what-to-look-out-for/1580">link</a> explains the detail if you're interested. Whilst more features would seem better, the basic 6 DOF version was all you really needed for FPV racing or freestyle.

        <p><img id="tmotor" src="images/tmotor.jpg" alt="T-Motor SN2204 2300KV">Next up I needed motors and this was a lot more confusing, trying to decifer what all the statistics really meant and what amps they would pull with what propellors had me confused. Charpu was using Lumenier motors but they were some of the most expensive available and beyond my budget at the time. During my research I discovered that Lumenier motors are produced by and in some cases just rebadged T-Motors.
        </p>
        <p> The price was better on the T-Motors so I went ahead and brought the MN2204 2300KV, two with clockwise threads and two with anticlockwise threads. I should note here that whilst those motors were actually great performers for my first 6 months of flying, they're not Lumenier motors and they were limited in both performance and they only supported 3S 11.4 volt batteries, something I'd come to regret later down the line. Ironically, these motors have maintained their price whilst the original EMAX RS2205's (the motors I kind of wish I'd brought now) can normally be found for less than half their cost. I don't know who's buying the Navigators but clearly they're still well regarded by some people out there.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><img id="dys" src="images/DYS sn16a.jpg" alt="DYS sn16a ESC">Now I needed some ESC's for the motors and in this case I lucked out again. At the time there were a number of different brands available on the market and a lot of people where talking about LittleBee's who still make great ESC's today but sometimes have a reputation for being a bit noisy (link to article). Instead I decided to buy from a company called DYS, still relatively new at that time, DYS are now considered by many to have some of the best ESC's on the market. I wasn't entirely sure as to how the amps and motors correlated at the time but I found a spec sheet on T-Motors website which suggested the motors would only pull around 9 amps with the 5x3 propellors so I purchased their 16 amps ESC's. If I had of brought different motors like the original EMAX RS2205's (the motors that I subsequently wished I had brought) then 16 amps would potentially have been too small but I didn't learn that until quite a while later on.
