            <h4>OSD - On Screen Display</h4>
              <p id="osd">A device that provides the ability to superimpose text information over the video output. Common types of information would include battery voltage, current draw, current used during current flight session, total time of flight session, call sign, flight mode and vertical or horizontal bars to illustrate angle of attack much like you would expect to see on a plane flight simulator or game.</p>
            <h4>DOF - Degrees of Freedom</h4>
              <p id="dof">Term used to describe the number of directions of movement available to the device. In the conext of quadcopters, pitch, yaw and roll would be considered 6 Degrees of Freedom, two for each axis of movement. 8 DOF adds altitude via a barometer or compass direction via a magnetometer. 10 DOF would include both.</p>
