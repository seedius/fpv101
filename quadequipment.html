        <h1>Anatomy of a quadcopter</h1>
        <p>In the first section of this equipment guide we're going to look at the components that make up a typical FPV quadcopter. However, before we get into that it's worth noting that we're blessed with some truly excellent RTF (Ready to Fly) or BNF (Bind and Fly) kits that you can purchase. These kits come with everything needed to fly except batteries and they offer a great solution for people who just want to get going and don't have a burning desire to assemble their quad from scratch. The components you get with these kits are normally of a decent if not high quality and in the vast majority of cases you should be able to easily remove and repair or upgrade components as your skills and knowledge increases.
        </P>
        <p>Another similar option is to commission someone to build you a quad, there a a number of online stores that offer build services when you buy all your kit from them or alternatively you may find members at your local club that can help. I also offer commission builds in the UK, if you're interested then check out my build page here.
        </p>
        <p>For the rest of you out there, building and configuring your quad may be a significant part of the fun and there is no doubt it's very satisfying when you fly your creation for the first time. This will definitely appeal to modellers and engineers alike but with that said, whilst it's useful to have some basic soldering skills, everything can be learnt without much difficulty. Check out our Hobby Skills section for more guidance on this aspect.</p>
