        <p>Welcome to FPV 101. This site has built to try and provide an introduction
        and guide for those of you out there that are interested in getting into the
        hobby of FPV quadcopters and other forms of multirotor.</p>

        <p>There is an absolute ton of information out there in the world for people
        entering the hobby. Rather than reproduce that content, our aim is to provide
        you with an index or contents page of sorts to help lead you straight
        to the best info and help you get up to speed as quickly and cost effectively
        as possible.</p>

        <p>Like every hobby out there, a lot of the information published by the community
        is full of acronyms, gargon and references that don't always make sense to those
        that are just entering the hobby. As the scene continues to grow, more and more content
        is produced and it becomes harder to navigate and harder to figure out what to trust.</p>

        <p>Like everything on the internet, always consider information you find with a pinch
        of salt, this site included. Whilst we will do our best to steer you right, there
        is no substitute for common sense and a bit of background research. Check out "LINK"
        our guide on 'Finding the answers' to learn more about how to research information
        and how to recognise good advice from the bad.</p>

        <p>Anyway, enough rambling from us. We hope you find this useful and we Welcome
        feedback or suggestions on improvements to the site so please get in touch.</p>
