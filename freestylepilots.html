      <h1>Freestyle Pilots</h1>

      <p>I've classified freestyle pilots as those who have gained notoriety due to their freestyle flying and videos. This doesn't mean to say they're not also great racers, reviewers or technologists. It is in fact common to find that they're strong on fronts but equally, more than a few freestylers will be first to tell you they're not great at racing.
      </p>
      <p>This list is a work in progress and will updated over time. The decision to include names in this list is based not just on their ability as a pilot but also their YouTube presence. It's a lot harder for you to be inspired by a pilot if you can't watch them fly. <br><br>With that said, if there are names I've missed then please drop me a line and I'll try to get them added asap.

      <h3>Mr Steele (Steele Davis)</h3>
      <p>Right now Mr Steele is arguably the most famous freestyle pilot in the hobby. With well over 100k plus followers on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MrSteeledavis">YouTube channel</a> he's the person you're most likely to hear about when coming into the hobby. Until recently a key member of 'Rotor Riot' crew, he also has close ties with Team Black Sheep and Alien frames, working with both brands to produce the <a href="http://team-blacksheep.com/products/prod:mrsteele_silk">TBS 'Mr Steel' 1450kv Silk Motors</a> and his own <a href="https://impulserc.com/products/mr-steele-5-alien-frame-kit-kiss-pdb-with-osd">quad frame and custom PDB</a>, a variant of the ever popular ImpulseRC Alien 5" Frame. Steele has also been a stauch supporter of the <a href="https://flyduino.net/KISS-FC-32bit-Flight-Controller-V103_1">KISS Flight Controller</a> and <a href="https://flyduino.net/ESC-brushless-motor-controller">KISS ESC's</a> for many years. His YouTube channel includes trick tutorials, set-up guides, quad builds and of course, lots of very slick freestyle flying.

      <h3>Le Drib (Drew Camden)</h3>
      <p>Drew Camden produces what I believe to be the best vlog out of all the pilots here. He's very comfortable in front of the lens and his videos are more than just fpv footage. He openly talks about wanting to push artistic boundries and show followers the whole story behind his pursuit of the hobby, not just him flying. As a freestyle pilot he has by far the smoothest style, sometimes shying away from some of the crazier flips and rolls in favour of sweeping lines and tricks that are a real joy to watch. On his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHxiKnzTyzE9Qez8ZGpQbPQ">YouTube channel</a> you'll find trick tutorials, builds, lots of honest dialogue and a lot of taco's (he loves eating taco's apparently). <br><br>After recently quitting his day job to pursue the hobby full time it was annouced he was joining <a href="http://www.rotorriot.com/">RotorRiot</a> and there is a strong sense that he will replace Steele Davis as their front man in due course. He has his own <a href="">frame</a>, a variant of the well regarded 'Fusion' frame made by local Detroit company MQC. Drew has also been flying DYS flight controllers and motors despite not being sponsored by them, only very recently swapping out to the RotorRiot Hypetrains. Equally he also flys with Skyzone VS02 goggles rather than Fatsharks which 99% of the other pilots fly.

      <h3>Charpu (Carlos Puertolas)</h3>
      <p>Charpu rose to fame back in 2013/2014 when he became the face of drone racing within the wider public domain. Featured in a bunch of mainstream publications and articles focused on the emerging hobby of 'drone racing' a nod to the fact he's also a great racing pilot as well as a freestyler. Carlos was the pilot I and many others first discovered, his sequences flying through abandoned buildings are absolutely addictive to watch. Sponsored by <a href="http://www.lumenier.com">Lumenier</a> and subsequently joined to <a href="http://www.rotorriot.com/">RotorRiot</a>, he has his own <a href="https://www.charpu.com/">website</a>, instagram and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CharpuFPV">YouTube channel</a>. He also has two Lumenier frames after his name, the freestyle <a href="http://www.lumenier.com/products/multirotors/qav180-qav210">QAV210</a> and the racing <a href="http://www.lumenier.com/products/multirotors/qav-x">QAV-X</a>
