        <h3>What is FPV?</h3>

        <p>FPV is the abreviation of First Person Video. For those of you out there that have ever played computer games, you'll probablu be familiar with the term FPS or First Person Shooter. Alternatively you may know cockpit view from car or flight simulators. In each example, your view of the game is presented as if you were the game character rather than a third person watching events unfold. The same principle is used in FPV multirotors.
        </p>
        <p>Within the context of radio control models, the vast majority of hobbiest have been steering their models using line of sight, mentally adjusting their control inputs to compensate for the direction the model is traveling in at any given point. If your model is moving away from you, left is left and right is right. However if you turn around and head back towards yourself, left now becomes right and vise versa.
        </p>
        <p>With FPV flying, we replace our 'line of sight' viewpoint with a screen that we typically wear as a set of goggles. The goggles project an video feed that is being projected from a camera mounted on the front of the quadcopter, therein delivering the 'first person' perspective. Whilst FPV flying is considered an RC hobby on paper, the parralles with computer gaming can make it a lot quicker to learn for some. It should be noted that early FPV started with planes long before quadcopters were a thing. FPV planes also open up a whole separate discipline, that of long distance FPV, something that is less well suited to multirotors.
