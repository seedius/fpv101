        <h1>Introduction to equipment</h1>
        <p>So you've probably already discovered that FPV quadcopter flying can be a pretty
          expensive hobby in general. Some out there will definitely argue that if you're
          prepared to spend thousand of your your hard earned currency then FPV isn't the hobby for you.
          There is certainly some truth in that but in the last 12-18 months the amount of tech you
          can buy for your money has improved significantly. In this section we're going to dig into
          what equipment you'll need, what stuff you'll really want to have and some of the less critical
          gear that makes life easier if you can afford it.</p>

        <p>When it comes to equipment there are a ton of guides already out there that do a good job
        of explaining the basics. However, be aware that a number of these guides are produced by stores
        that sell stuff and whilst that doesn't make them inacurate by default, the brands and the kit they
        suggest may well be based on the stuff they stock.....they're not going to point you towards gear
        they don't sell so keep that in mind.</p>

        <p>It's also important to bear in mind that the pace of innovation in this hobby means that shiny
        new becomes old very quick and it can be tempting to get caught up in the hype. If you've got the money
        to do that then great but equally, you can buy some great stuff that will be more than capable without
        needing the latest and greatest. The important considerations are future compatibility and ease of
        replacement. You WILL break stuff, so when you're starting out you might well decide that the 15 buck motors
        suit you better than the 30 buck motors because you can afford to replace all four corners for the
        same money and you're unlikely to notice the 10-15% performace gain in the short term.</p>

        <p>The community has some great tech reviewers, Stu from UAV Futures and Joshua Bardwell are
        arguably some of the most prominent right now and do a great job of outlining the pro's and con's of
        new kit hitting the market. There are also some great websites that test new equipment the most obvious being
        <a href="http://www.miniquadtestbench.com/">Miniquad Bench Test</a> who test motors and publish stats
        on their performace. Check out our 'People who Know' for more details about their sites or YouTube channels.</p>
